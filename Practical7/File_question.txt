Question:
Use a plot to show how have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spanish.


line number:42-50

discussion: 
Through the plot, I can find that there were no cases until 12 March 2020 and then the number of total cases rised rapidly. 
The number of new cases increased over a long time and then dropped a little.
